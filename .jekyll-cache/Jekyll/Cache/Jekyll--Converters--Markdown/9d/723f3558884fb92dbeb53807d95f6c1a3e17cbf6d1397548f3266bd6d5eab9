<p>Hi, I am Hitesh Kumar, a Deep Learning enthusiast (computer vision based mostly). Well, i agree the word ‚Äòenthusiast‚Äô is extravagant. So, I take alot of interest in learning about technologies. I am accidental deep learning engineer who graduated as Mechanical Engineer. This blog is for my thoughts which i struggle conveying inperson. So it may cover technical and non technical aspect.</p>

<p><em>Writing is alot easier, isn‚Äôt it?</em></p>

<p>My current interests range from Deep Learning (could be more obvious?), Data structure, Implementing research papers. On the non-tech side, i am inclined toward novels, documentaries, animal facts, listening to classical music, reading history..</p>

<p>I was the head of Software Department of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/infernodtu/?originalSubdomain=in">Inferno DTU</a> where we developed Mars Rover Prototype to Compete at ‚ÄúIndian Rover Challange‚Äù. I was also Machine Vision Researcher at Inferno DTU when team developed Go-Kart. I have published 2 Research papers</p>
