##### Who AM I ? :

Hi, I am Hitesh Kumar, a Deep Learning enthusiast (computer vision based mostly). Well, i agree the word 'enthusiast' is extravagant. So, I take alot of interest in learning about technologies. I am accidental deep learning engineer who graduated as Mechanical Engineer. This blog is for my thoughts which i struggle conveying inperson. So it may cover technical and non technical aspect. 

_Writing is alot easier, isn't it?_

My current interests range from Deep Learning (could be more obvious?), Data structure, Implementing research papers. On the non-tech side, i am inclined toward novels, documentaries, animal facts, listening to classical music, reading history.. 


I was the head of Software Department of [Inferno DTU](https://www.linkedin.com/company/infernodtu/?originalSubdomain=in) where we developed Mars Rover Prototype to Compete at "Indian Rover Challange". I was also Machine Vision Researcher at Inferno DTU when team developed Go-Kart. I have published 2 Research papers


###### PAPERS :
-  Analytical and Computational Modelling of Go-Kart Powertrains. International Journal of Mechanical and Production Engineering Research and Development (IJMPERD) 

- Estimation Of Surface Roughness in turning operations using Multivariate Polynomial Regression. Future Learning Aspects of Mechanical Engineering (FLAME - 2020)
